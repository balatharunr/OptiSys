# OptiSys

Windows maintenance companion for builders who prioritize safety, repeatability, and observability. OptiSys coordinates PowerShell 7 automations through managed .NET services so every action is guarded, logged, and reversible and heavily secure.

## At a Glance

- Latest stable: **1.0.0** ([data/catalog/latest-release.json](data/catalog/latest-release.json))
- Docs: [docs/](docs)
- Roadmap: [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)
- Press: [Press-and-Reviews.md](Press-and-Reviews.md)

## Core Capabilities

- **Essentials repair center** ([docs/essentials.md](docs/essentials.md)): Curated fixes for networking, Defender, printing, and Windows Update with dry-run previews, sequential execution, restore points, and transcripts.
- **Cleanup and storage hygiene** ([docs/cleanup.md](docs/cleanup.md)): Preview clutter, apply risk-aware deletions with recycle-bin-first flows, and schedule recurring sweeps.
- **Registry optimizer** ([docs/registry-optimizer.md](docs/registry-optimizer.md)): Stage presets or custom tweaks with JSON restore points, rollback countdowns, baseline tracking, and preset customization alerts.
- **Install and maintain software** ([docs/install-hub.md](docs/install-hub.md), [docs/maintenance.md](docs/maintenance.md)): Drive winget, Scoop, and Chocolatey from one queue and keep curated bundles current.
- **PathPilot and process intelligence** ([docs/pathpilot.md](docs/pathpilot.md), [docs/known-processes.md](docs/known-processes.md)): Safely manage PATH edits, monitor running processes, and escalate Threat Watch findings with remediation guidance.
- **Startup controller** ([docs/startup-controller.md](docs/startup-controller.md)): Inventory Run/RunOnce, Startup folders, logon tasks, and services with accurate enabled/disabled states, reversible backups, delays, and guardrails.
- **PulseGuard observability** ([docs/activity-log.md](docs/activity-log.md), [docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md)): Turn significant Activity Log events into actionable notifications, prompts, and searchable transcripts.
- **Backup & Restore (Reset Rescue)** ([docs/backup.md](docs/backup.md)): Archive and restore user/app data and registry ahead of OS resets or migrations, with manifest-based integrity, VSS snapshot support, and granular restore options. See [data/backup/README.md](data/backup/README.md) for storage layout and samples.

## Safety by Design

- Restore-point enforcement for high-risk flows, with pruning to stay within disk budgets.
- Cleanup guardrails: protected roots, skip-recent filters, recycle-bin preference, lock inspection, and permission-repair fallbacks.
- Sequential automation queues with cancellation hooks, deterministic logging, and retry policies.
- PulseGuard notification gating that respects user toggles, window focus, and cooldown windows.
- Activity Log plus JSON/Markdown transcripts for audits, with direct "View log" actions.
- PathPilot safeguards that validate, diff, and checkpoint PATH changes before applying them.

## Architecture Overview

- Frontend: WPF (.NET 8) views with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm view models ([src/OptiSys.App](src/OptiSys.App)).
- Services: C# services for cleanup, registry state, automation scheduling, PowerShell invocation, and tray presence ([src/OptiSys.Core](src/OptiSys.Core), [src/OptiSys.App/Services](src/OptiSys.App/Services)).
- Automation: PowerShell 7 scripts in [automation/](automation) for essentials, cleanup, registry, and diagnostics; YAML/JSON catalogs describe tweaks, presets, processes, and bundles.
- Packaging: Inno Setup installer ([installer/OptiSysInstaller.iss](installer/OptiSysInstaller.iss)) plus self-contained release artifacts in GitHub Releases.

## Install and Run

Prerequisites: Windows 10 or later, .NET SDK 8.0+, PowerShell 7 on PATH.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/balatharunr/OptiSys.git
cd OptiSys

dotnet restore src/OptiSys.sln
dotnet build src/OptiSys.sln -c Debug

dotnet run --project src/OptiSys.App/OptiSys.App.csproj
```

## Test Suite

```powershell
dotnet test tests/OptiSys.Core.Tests/OptiSys.Core.Tests.csproj
dotnet test tests/OptiSys.Automation.Tests/OptiSys.Automation.Tests.csproj
dotnet test tests/OptiSys.App.Tests/OptiSys.App.Tests.csproj
```

- Tools in [tools/](tools) validate catalog consistency ([tools/check_duplicate_packages.py](tools/check_duplicate_packages.py), [tools/suggest_catalog_fixes.py](tools/suggest_catalog_fixes.py)) and PowerShell flows ([tools/test-process-catalog-parser.ps1](tools/test-process-catalog-parser.ps1)).
- PulseGuard and the Activity Log surface runtime confirmation for long-running automations.
